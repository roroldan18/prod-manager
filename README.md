# Product Manager

## It's an application I developed as a Junior developer task.

### Requirements

- The form should be dynamically changed when the type is switched.
- Special attributes should have a description, related to their type, e.g.: “Please, provide dimensions” / “Please, provide weight” / “Please, provide size” when related product type is selected.
- All fields are mandatory for submission, missing values should trigger notification “Please, submit required data”.
- Implement input field value validation, invalid data must trigger notification “Please, provide the data of indicated type”.
- Notification messages should appear on the same page without reloading.
- The page must have a “Save” button to save the product. Once saved, return to the “Product List” page with the new product added.
- The page must have a “Cancel” button to cancel adding the product action. Once canceled, returned to the “Product List” page with no new products added.
- No additional dialogues like “Are you sure you want to Save / Cancel?”
- SKU should be unique for each product and it shouldn’t be possible to save products if already any product with the same SKU exists.
